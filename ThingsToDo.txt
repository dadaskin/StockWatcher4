Stock Watcher Update Tasks
--------------------------
DONE  Download latest versions of Android Studio and various tools
DONE  Get Emulators to emulate Galaxy S4
DONE  Import StockWatcher project to Android Studio
DONE  Preliminary testing of StockWatcher in Android Studio
?	  - Blocks don't display when symbol is tapped. (Sometimes)
?	  - Putting the latest apk onto emulator directly shows same symptoms, so
	      this may be a problem with the emulator.
?	  - Non-displaying blocks seem to be random, a symbol works one time and doesn't another.
DONE  - Try on tablet (Android 4.4)  Old APK works properly (directly installed)
DONE  - Try installing source from Android Studio onto tablet.  Works properly.  Ignore emulator weirdness for now.
